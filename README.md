Coursera Project Network – Data Science Challenge (Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning)
# 🧠 Data Science Challenge – Customer Churn Prediction

This repository contains my submission for the **Coursera Project Network: Data Science Challenge**.

## 📘 Project Overview
The challenge was to build a **machine learning model** that predicts customer churn using a real-world dataset. The goal was to identify key patterns that indicate whether a customer is likely to leave a service.

## 🧩 Key Techniques
- Python, Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization  
- Scikit-learn for model building and evaluation  
- Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting  
- Feature engineering, normalization, and hyperparameter tuning  

## 🎯 Objective
To achieve the **highest possible prediction accuracy** and derive insights that can help businesses improve **customer retention**.

## 🧮 Results
- Achieved accuracy of **XX%** (replace with your actual accuracy)  
- Gradient Boosting model performed best  
- Top features influencing churn: tenure, contract type, monthly charges  

## 🚀 Business Impact
The model helps identify at-risk customers early and allows companies to design retention strategies to reduce churn rates and increase customer satisfaction.
